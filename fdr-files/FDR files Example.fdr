A
3 This is the needed beginning of the file: 'A' or 'I' for 'Apple' or 'IBM' carriage-returns, followed by an IMMEDIATE carriage return, followed by the version number of 3

COMM, This is a sample FDR file, use it to generate your own Flight Data Recorder files!

COMM, for the ACFT label, enter the aicraft path in X-Plane
COMM, for the TAIL label, enter the tail number
COMM, for the TIME label, enter the local time in xx:xx:xx format
COMM, for the DATE label, enter the local time in xx/xx/xx format
COMM, for the PRES label, enter the local baro pressure in inches
COMM, for the DISA label, enter the temperature offset from ISA in degrees C
COMM, for the WIND label, enter the wind direction and speed in knots

COMM, Now, below that, see the DREF lines?
COMM, Each of those is a dataref in X-Plane, followed by a unit conversion to go from your desired input to the X-Plane units, which are typically english for indications, and metric for internal data.
COMM, See the total list at https://developer.x-plane.com/datarefs/
COMM, These are the datarefs you will drive each frame in the sim... Enter as few or as many as you like!

COMM, Now, see the DATA lines below?
COMM, Each of those is a TIME IN SECONDS FROM FILE-START, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, ELEVATION IN FEET, MAGNETIC HEADING, PITCH, AND ROLL IN DEGREES
COMM, Then, after that, comes the values of each of the datarefs listed by the DREFS, in order!

COMM, So, you just list all the datarefs you like in the DREF labels, with some tabs or spaces and then a conversion factor for each, and then the data for those datarefs per-frame in the DATA labels after the time, location, and attitude!
COMM, What an easy format!
COMM, This lets you keep the files as short as you like... or add as much detail as you like as well!
COMM, Be sure to use COMMAS after each label!
